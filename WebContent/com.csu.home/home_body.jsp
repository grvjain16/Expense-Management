      <p>Expense Management automation is the means by which an organization can significantly reduce transaction costs and improve management control when logging, calculating 
      and processing corporate expenses. Independent research evaluating the use of automated expense management systems has confirmed that the cost of processing an expense claim 
      is reduced as the level of automation increases.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Expense reports</h1>
      <p>Expense reports are the required reports that employees or travelers need to submit in order to account for their expenses and/or get a reimbursement. Specifically, expense
       reports are made up of individual line items for reasonable charges while performing a particular job or traveling for a specific job-related requirement. These charges can include
        meals, hotels, company supplies, printing materials, or flights. The employee then provides proof of the purchase with a receipt and all related expenses (from a particular trip or
        a particular project, for example) will go into the expense report.</p>
